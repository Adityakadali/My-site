I've started this #100daysOfCode challege to switch industry. After doing some side projects like building discord bots and tools for my job. I've learned that I'm very passionate about programming and I like it so much that even though I had sleepless nights while learning I barely feel like I'm working. 

### 30 Days of Coding Update

I took **Full Stack Web Development** Course on Ineuron and completed 20%

In this 30 days of learning I've learnt HTML & CSS and Some JavaScript

Even though I know little bit of **HTML and CSS** before I never felt comfortable writing before. In this 30 Days of coding I can now structure HTML documents cleanly and write CSS as I wanted to look them and able to replicate designs I found. 

**JavaScript** I can do DOM with JavaScript finally. I am able to write some arrow functions and Fetch external APIs as I needed. A lot to learn here.
